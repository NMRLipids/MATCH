# MATCH

This is a databank of lipid bilayer MD simulations, experimental NMR and scattering data contributed to the NMRlipids project (nmrlipids.blogspot.fi).

The <b>Data</b> folder contains a subfolder for each system. The <b>system subfolders</b> contain experimental 
NMR and scattering data.  The <b>system subfolders</b> contain also folders for available models.
The systems are also indexed in a SQL database in www.nmrlipids.fi

Automatic analysis routines are currently available for C-H bond order parameters
https://github.com/NMRLipids/MATCH/blob/master/scripts/order_parameters_calculate.sh
and for scattering form factors
https://github.com/NMRLipids/MATCH/blob/master/scripts/calc_FORM_FACTOR.sh
