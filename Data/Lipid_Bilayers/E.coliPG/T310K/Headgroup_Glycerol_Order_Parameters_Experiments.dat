# Table I
# Average value of measurements with differently labelled lipids
# are given for g1R, g1S and alpha
# 
# According the experiments by Tiago Ferreira of POPG for NMRlipids IV,
# the signs for alpha and beta are positive, gamma and glycerol backbone are negative
#
# 0 = gamma
# 1 = beta
# 2 = alpha
# 3 = g3 
# 4 = g2 
# 5 = g1
